    <p>
        Hello everyone! I'm Oladele from Lagos, Nigeria. You can reach me via my email - dele.oyedeji@gmail.com or via WhatsApp at +2348033355345. <br><br>
        I am married with four lovely children; as for my academic, I specialize in Applied management, with a minor in web design. Career wise, I'm transition from graphic design to focusing on UI/UX design. I am taking Web Design to gain more knowledge and skills in interactive designs, to expand my career opportunities, and to qualify for international work through remote work or sponsored jobs abroad. <br><br>
        Additionally, I have a passion for cooking and enjoy helping "her" out in the kitchen. As for meals, I love beans and roasted plantain (boli). <br><br>
        Thank you for having me in this group, and I look forward to engaging with all of you.
